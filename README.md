# vlr-project
This repo will host code for my Visual Learning & Recognition class project at CMU.

The goal of the project was to find out relationship between hashtags of an image on Twitter and the tags predicted for the image by a ConvNet. 

The project uses Twitter and Clarifai APIs to acheive this. It also uses NumPy and Scikit for various other tasks.
I hope to take this work forward by integrating with Instagram and Flickr as well.
